					<h2 class="details__heading">Stay with us!</h2>
					<p class="section__body section__body--transport ">We are really excited to be getting married this summer and want our closest friends and family to enjoy the wedding as much as we will. Which is why we would like to invite you to stay with us at Tresillian House.</p>
					<p class="section__body section__body--transport ">Tresillian House is a beautiful country manor house built in 1849. The house is set within 22 acres of lawns, orchards and a victorian walled garden producing flowers and vegetables for the house. We will have private access to the property and grounds for the whole weekend from Friday 12th until Monday 15th July.</p>

					<h2 class="details__heading">The rooms</h2>
					<p class="section__body section__body--transport">Alongside the main house, there is also a converted apple store and a farm house. Between the three buildings we have enough room for our close friends and family to stay for the whole weekend.</p>
						<p class="section__body section__body--transport ">Most of the rooms are large double bedrooms, with a couple of big twin rooms, and most have ensuite bathrooms. The three buildings also have their own shared kitchens and living areas, as well as larger shared bathrooms.</p>
						<p class="section__body section__body--transport ">You will be able to use the rooms from Friday afternoon (exact time TBC) until 10am on Monday morning, but you can arrive and leave at any time that suits you.</p>

					<h2 class="details__heading">The cost</h2>
					<p class="section__body section__body--transport ">As everyone's circumstances are different, we have calculated the cost per person for the full weekend (from 12th through to 15th). The weekend stay will cost Â£75pp.</p>
					<p class="section__body section__body--transport ">During your stay we will make sure the kitchens are well-stocked for breakfasts, there are fresh towels and linen, and you will have internet access. There is also space for cars to be parked in the front driveway or to the rear of the property on the day of the wedding itself.</p>
					
					<p class="section__body section__body--transport ">A big plus is that you won't need to worry about booking a taxi for the end of the night!</p>
